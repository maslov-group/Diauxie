### figure 1

figure 1 is a schematic presentation of our model settings. It should include all these things:

- That we are dealing with diauxic bugs. To do that, we will have log scale time-density plots, with lags and lines with different slopes. we will also have nutrient concentration vs time plots, where you can see the stepwise depletion of nutrients. 

- That we are under this experimental setting, where we introduce the species one by one into serial dilution, and we only draw in a new species form the global species pool after we have reached a steady state. 

  For that, we need a cartoon showing the gedanken experiment process and a big density-time plot, showing a lot of cycles.

### figure 2

figure 2 is where we show people that **the system is really self-organizing** and what it looks like. 

- we show 3 important features: efficiency (Tmax), diversity, and complementarity. They vary with time, and we need to define this complementarity regarding nutrients as avoiding conflicts. 
- We would also need a panel showing that there's no such organization regarding compl. on other nutrients than the top one. This should be a box plot. 
- We would also need to regard the rareness of freaks. By that we make a proportion of freaks vs. time plot. 
- We also show the speed of self-organization. This is done by adding an inset of attempted invasion vs. succeeded invasion. 



- PS a main issue is about the complementarity. 

  - Where should we put the complementarities

    In figure 2, we present some emergent properties of the system, such as that the functionality increases, the diversity increases, and the anomalous bugs disappear. These things happen at the timescale of species pool invasion, namely, they happen gradually during the whole process of all these 1e4 invasions from the species pool. 

    The complementarity increase, on the other hand, is something that happens at a shorter timescale. This timescale is the time between individual invasions. In  

### figure 3

figure 3 is where we explain these things by our model. We would use a picture of interplay between invader's pref order and system's depletion order. 

- there's a cartoon of this process. it should be showing the leapfrog pattern, with both the depletion order change and the actual species composition. 

- there's a plot showing that invaders invade at the last depleted resources.  after trials we decided that it's clearer a dot plot than a bar plot.

- there's a plot showing that the system's depletion order is affected by the invasions.

### figure 4

There should be cartoons and Tilman-ish plots showing that 1) complementarity helps and 2) anomaly sucks. 

- with the one that shows complementarity helps:
  - one diagram with only one bug. It shows: T1 and T2; possible and impossible region;
